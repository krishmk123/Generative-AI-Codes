        "As a Gen AI Data Scientist at InnoviTech Solutions, the objective is to develop an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based system tailored for the Global Nutrition Health Organization. This system is designed to support users by streamlining the extraction and integration of vital nutritional information from extensive resources, such as the Nutritional Medical Reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The application aims to enable healthcare providers to quickly access information regarding symptoms, diagnoses, treatment plans, and more, thereby reducing the need for lengthy manual searches. The RAG-based chatbot will be built with a custom advanced workflow that includes the following key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Query Expansion:** Enhancing user queries to improve retrieval accuracy without altering the original intent. This step ensures that the user's queries are refined to capture the most relevant information from the extensive nutritional resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Context Retrieval:** Fetching relevant documents from a vector store based on the expanded or original query. This step is crucial to provide contextually relevant information that the model can use to generate accurate responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Response Generation:** Crafting accurate and informative responses strictly adhering to the retrieved context. This ensures that the AI provides information directly from the trusted nutritional sources, maintaining reliability and relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Groundedness Evaluation:** Assessing the factual alignment of the generated response with the retrieved context. This step ensures that the responses generated by the AI are factually correct and based on the provided context, enhancing the credibility of the information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Precision Evaluation:** Scoring the precision of the response in addressing the user's query. This step evaluates how well the response addresses the specific query of the user, ensuring relevance and usefulness.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Response Refinement:** Providing constructive feedback to improve gaps, ambiguities, or missing details in the response. If the response does not meet the groundedness or precision criteria, it is refined to ensure it meets the required standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Query Refinement:** Suggesting improvements for the expanded query to enhance search precision. If the response needs further improvement, the query itself is refined to ensure better retrieval in subsequent iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of these operations is to ensure that the AI provides the best possible response from the context provided, strictly adhering to the nutritional disorder manuals. By performing these operations, we ensure that the responses are both accurate and relevant, meeting the high standards expected in healthcare.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow diagram, included below, visually represents this advanced workflow, highlighting the iterative process of grounding, precision checking, and refinement to achieve the most accurate and useful responses:"

We begin by installing and importing the necessary libraries, followed by unzipping the documents and setting up configurations for OpenAI models. Next, we parse PDF content using LlamaParse to extract tables and validate parsed JSON objects. We then perform semantic chunking of text for structured retrieval, and generate hypothetical questions and metadata for these text chunks and tables. Finally, we store everything in ChromaDB, ensuring efficient retrieval and processing of relevant information for the bot's responses. This structured approach equips the AI with the ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries related to nutritional disorders."

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nNutrition is the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrients are chemicals in foods that are\\nused by the body for growth, maintenance, and energy. Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body\\nand thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some\\namino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds,\\nalthough they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are\\nrequired by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\\n\\nLack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p.\\n9). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56) and related disorders; excess intake of\\nmicro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much\\nusaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nMacronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients.\\nCarbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids),\\nmacrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as\\nsources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g).\\n\\nCarbohydrates: Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides.\\nCarbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, supplying energy. Simple carbohydrates are composed of\\nsmall molecules, generally monosaccharides or disaccharides, which increase blood glucose levels\\nrapidly. Complex carbohydrates are composed of larger molecules, which are broken down into\\nmonosaccharides. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels more slowly but for a longer\\ntime. Glucose and sucrose are simple carbohydrates; starches and fiber are complex carbohydrates.\\n\\nThe glycemic index measures how rapidly consumption of a carbohydrate increases plasma glucose\\nlevels. Values range from 1 (the slowest increase) to 100 (the fastest increase, equivalent to pure glucose\\n\\u2014see\\nTable 1-1). However, the actual rate of increase also depends on what foods are consumed with the\\ncarbohydrate.\\n\\nCarbohydrates with a high glycemic index may increase plasma glucose to high levels rapidly. It is\\nhypothesized that, as a result, insulin levels increase, inducing hypoglycemia and hunger, which tends to\\nlead to consumption of excess calories and weight gain. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index\\nincrease plasma glucose levels slowly, resulting in lower postprandial insulin levels and less hunger,\\nwhich probably makes consumption of excess calories less likely. These effects are predicted to result in\\na more favorable lipid profile and a decreased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and complications of\\ndiabetes if present.\\n\\nProteins: Dietary proteins are broken down into peptides and amino acids. Proteins are required for\\ntissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth. However, if the body is not getting enough\\ncalories from dietary sources or tissue stores (particularly of fat), protein may be used for energy.\\n\\nAs the body uses dietary protein for tissue production, there is a net gain of protein (positive nitrogen\\nbalance).

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n\\n# 1 - Nutritional Disorders\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nNutrition is the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrients are chemicals in foods that are used by the body for growth, maintenance, and energy. Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body and thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some amino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds, although they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are required by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\\n\\nLack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p. 9). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56) and related disorders; excess intake of micro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much unsaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.\\n\\n# Macronutrients\\n\\nMacronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids), macrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as sources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g).\\n\\n# Carbohydrates:\\n\\nDietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, supplying energy. Simple carbohydrates are composed of small molecules, generally monosaccharides or disaccharides, which increase blood glucose levels rapidly. Complex carbohydrates are composed of larger molecules, which are broken down into monosaccharides. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels more slowly but for a longer time. Glucose and sucrose are simple carbohydrates; starches and fiber are complex carbohydrates.\\n\\nThe glycemic index measures how rapidly consumption of a carbohydrate increases plasma glucose levels. Values range from 1 (the slowest increase) to 100 (the fastest increase, equivalent to pure glucose \\u2014see Table 1-1). However, the actual rate of increase also depends on what foods are consumed with the carbohydrate.\\n\\nCarbohydrates with a high glycemic index may increase plasma glucose to high levels rapidly. It is hypothesized that, as a result, insulin levels increase, inducing hypoglycemia and hunger, which tends to lead to consumption of excess calories and weight gain. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index increase plasma glucose levels slowly, resulting in lower postprandial insulin levels and less hunger, which probably makes consumption of excess calories less likely. These effects are predicted to result in a more favorable lipid profile and a decreased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and complications of diabetes if present.\\n\\n# Proteins:\\n\\nDietary proteins are broken down into peptides and amino acids. Proteins are required for tissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth. However, if the body is not getting enough calories from dietary sources or tissue stores (particularly of fat), protein may be used for energy.\\n\\nAs the body uses dietary protein for tissue production, there is a net gain of protein (positive nitrogen balance). During catabolic states (eg, starvation, infections, burns), more protein may be used (because body tissues are broken down) than is absorbed, resulting in a net loss of protein (negative nitrogen balance). Nitrogen balance is best determined by subtracting the amount of nitrogen excreted in urine and feces from the amount of nitrogen ingested.\\n\\n| Food     | Glycemic Index |\\n| -------- | -------------- |\\n| Glucose  | 100            |\\n| Sucrose  | 65             |\\n| Starches | Variable       |\\n| Fiber    | Variable       |\\n\\n\",\n",

Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\\nmetabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\\ndeveloped countries (see Ch. 5).\\n\\nOther minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\\nproved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\\ncompound with Ca (CaF2), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\\n\\nAll trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\\n\\nOther Dietary Substances\\n\\nThe daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\\nthese, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\\nuseful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the\\nproduction and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\\nmany other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\n\\nFiber: Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility,\\nprevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\\nof cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\\nsuggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\\npatients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\\n(present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\\nglucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\n\\nThe typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\\nflour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\\nmore vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\\nfiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\n\\nNutritional Requirements\\n\\nGood nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\\nand mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\\nweight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical\\nactivity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\\nthan needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n\\nDaily dietary requirements for essential nutrients also depend on age, sex, weight, and metabolic and\\nphysical activity. Every 5 yr, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences/National\\nResearch Council and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues the dietary reference intakes\\n(DRIs) for protein, energy, and some vitamins and minerals (see Tables 1-4,\\n4-1, and 5-2). For vitamins and minerals about which less is known, safe and adequate daily dietary\\nintakes are estimated.\\n\\nPregnant women (see p. 2608) and infants (see p. 2703) have special nutritional needs.\\n\\nThe USDA publishes the Food Guide Pyramid, which specifies the number of recommended daily\\nservings of various food groups. The recommendations are individualized based on age, sex, and\\nphysical activity (see\\nTable 1-5). Generally, the recommended intake decreases with aging because physical activity tends to\\ndecrease, resulting in less energy expended. The new Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes the following:\\n\\n\\u2022 Increasing consumption of whole grains\\n\\n\\u2022 Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits\\n\\n\\u2022 Substituting fat-free or low-fat milk products (or equivalents) for whole-fat milk products\\n\\n\\u2022 Reducing consumption of saturated fats and trans fatty acids\\n\\n\\u2022 Exercising regularly\\n\\nAdequate fluid intake is also important.\\n\\nFats should constitute \\u2264 30% of total calories, and saturated and trans fatty acids should constitute <\\n10%. Excess intake of saturated fats contributes to atherosclerosis. Substituting polyunsaturated fatty\\nacids for saturated fats can decrease the risk of atherosclerosis. Routine use of nutritional supplements is\\nnot necessary or beneficial; some supplements can be harmful. For example, excess vitamin A can lead to\\nhypervitaminosis A, with headaches, osteoporosis, and rash.\\n\\nNutrition in Clinical Medicine\\n\\nNutritional deficiencies can often worsen health outcomes (whether a disorder is present or not), and\\nsome disorders (eg, malabsorption) can cause nutritional deficiencies. Also, many patients (eg, elderly\\npatients during acute hospitalization) have unsuspected nutritional deficiencies that require treatment.\\nMany medical centers have multi-disciplinary nutrition support teams of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and\\npharmacists to help the clinician prevent, diagnose, and treat occult nutritional deficiencies.\\n\\nOvernutrition may contribute to chronic disorders, such as cancer, hypertension, obesity, diabetes\\nmellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nEvaluating general nutritional status includes history, physical examination, and sometimes tests. If\\nundernutrition is suspected, laboratory tests (eg, albumin levels) and skin tests for delayed\\nhypersensitivity may be done (see p.\\n13). Body composition analysis (eg, skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis) is used to\\nestimate percentage of body fat and to evaluate obesity (see p. 58).\\n\\nHistory includes questions about dietary intake, weight change, and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies\\nand a focused review of systems (see\\nTable 2-1 on p. 11). A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\\neaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\\neaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is\\nthe most accurate record.\\n\\nA complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body\\nfat, should be done. Body mass index (BMI)\\u2014weight(kg)/height(m)2, which adjusts weight for height (see\\nTable 6-2 on p. 59), is more accurate than height and weight tables. There are standards for growth and\\nweight gain in infants, children, and adolescents (see p. 2756).\\n\\nDistribution of body fat is important. Disproportionate truncal obesity (ie, waist/hip ratio > 0.8) is\\nassociated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus more\\noften than fat located elsewhere. Measuring waist circumference in patients with a BMI of < 35 helps\\ndetermine whether they have truncal obesity and helps predict risk of diabetes, hypertension,\\nhypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disorders. Risk is increased if waist circumference is > 102 cm\\n(> 40 in) in men or > 88 cm (> 35 in) in women.\\n\\nNutrient-Drug Interactions\\n\\nNutrition can affect the body's response to drugs; conversely, drugs can affect the body's nutrition.\\n\\nFoods can enhance, delay, or decrease drug absorption. Foods impair absorption of many antibiotics.\\nThey can alter metabolism of drugs; eg, high-protein diets can accelerate metabolism of certain drugs by\\nstimulating cytochrome P-450. Eating grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P-450 34A, slowing metabolism of\\nsome drugs (eg, amiodarone, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, certain Ca channel blockers). Diets that alter\\nthe bacterial flora may markedly affect the overall metabolism of certain drugs. Some foods affect the\\nbody's response to drugs. For example, tyramine, a component of cheese and a potent vasoconstrictor,\\ncan cause hypertensive crisis in some patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and eat cheese.\\n\\nNutritional deficiencies can affect drug absorption and metabolism. Severe energy and protein\\ndeficiencies reduce enzyme tissue concentrations and may impair the response to drugs by reducing\\nabsorption or protein binding and causing liver dysfunction. Changes in the GI tract can impair absorption\\nand affect the response to a drug. Deficiency of Ca, Mg, or zinc may impair drug metabolism. Vitamin C\\ndeficiency decreases activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially in the elderly.\\n\\nMany drugs affect appetite, food absorption, and tissue metabolism (see\\nTable 1-6). Some drugs (eg, metoclopramide) increase GI motility, decreasing food absorption. Other\\ndrugs (eg, opioids, anticholinergics) decrease GI motility. Some drugs are better tolerated if taken with\\nfood.\\n\\nCertain drugs affect mineral metabolism. For example, diuretics, especially thiazides, and corticosteroids\\ncan deplete body K, increasing susceptibility to digoxin-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated use of\\nlaxatives may deplete K. Cortisol, desoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone cause marked Na and water\\nretention, at least temporarily; retention is much less with prednisone, prednisolone, and some other\\ncorticosteroid analogs. Sulfonylureas and lithium can impair the uptake or release of iodine by the thyroid.\\nOral contraceptives can lower blood zinc levels and increase copper levels. Certain antibiotics (eg,\\ntetracyclines) reduce iron absorption, as can certain foods (eg, vegetables, tea, bran).\\n\\nCertain drugs affect vitamin absorption or metabolism. Ethanol impairs thiamin utilization, and isoniazid\\ninterferes with niacin and pyridoxine metabolism.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n\\nEvaluating general nutritional status includes history, physical examination, and sometimes tests. If undernutrition is suspected, laboratory tests (eg, albumin levels) and skin tests for delayed hypersensitivity may be done (see p. 13). Body composition analysis (eg, skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis) is used to estimate percentage of body fat and to evaluate obesity (see p. 58).\\n\\nHistory includes questions about dietary intake, weight change, and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies and a focused review of systems (see Table 2-1 on p. 11). A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods eaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods eaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is the most accurate record.\\n\\nA complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body fat, should be done. Body mass index (BMI)\\u2014weight(kg)/height(m)2, which adjusts weight for height (see Table 6-2 on p. 59), is more accurate than height and weight tables. There are standards for growth and weight gain in infants, children, and adolescents (see p. 2756).\\n\\nDistribution of body fat is important. Disproportionate truncal obesity (ie, waist/hip ratio > 0.8) is associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus more often than fat located elsewhere. Measuring waist circumference in patients with a BMI of &#x3C; 35 helps determine whether they have truncal obesity and helps predict risk of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disorders. Risk is increased if waist circumference is > 102 cm (> 40 in) in men or > 88 cm (> 35 in) in women.\\n\\n# Nutrient-Drug Interactions\\n\\nNutrition can affect the body's response to drugs; conversely, drugs can affect the body's nutrition.\\n\\nFoods can enhance, delay, or decrease drug absorption. Foods impair absorption of many antibiotics. They can alter metabolism of drugs; eg, high-protein diets can accelerate metabolism of certain drugs by stimulating cytochrome P-450. Eating grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P-450 34A, slowing metabolism of some drugs (eg, amiodarone, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, certain Ca channel blockers). Diets that alter the bacterial flora may markedly affect the overall metabolism of certain drugs. Some foods affect the body's response to drugs. For example, tyramine, a component of cheese and a potent vasoconstrictor, can cause hypertensive crisis in some patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and eat cheese.\\n\\nNutritional deficiencies can affect drug absorption and metabolism. Severe energy and protein deficiencies reduce enzyme tissue concentrations and may impair the response to drugs by reducing absorption or protein binding and causing liver dysfunction. Changes in the GI tract can impair absorption and affect the response to a drug. Deficiency of Ca, Mg, or zinc may impair drug metabolism. Vitamin C deficiency decreases activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially in the elderly.\\n\\nMany drugs affect appetite, food absorption, and tissue metabolism (see Table 1-6). Some drugs (eg, metoclopramide) increase GI motility, decreasing food absorption. Other drugs (eg, opioids, anticholinergics) decrease GI motility. Some drugs are better tolerated if taken with food.\\n\\nCertain drugs affect mineral metabolism. For example, diuretics, especially thiazides, and corticosteroids can deplete body K, increasing susceptibility to digoxin-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated use of laxatives may deplete K. Cortisol, desoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone cause marked Na and water retention, at least temporarily; retention is much less with prednisone, prednisolone, and some other corticosteroid analogs. Sulfonylureas and lithium can impair the uptake or release of iodine by the thyroid. Oral contraceptives can lower blood zinc levels and increase copper levels. Certain antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines) reduce iron absorption, as can certain foods (eg, vegetables, tea, bran).\\n\\nCertain drugs affect vitamin absorption or metabolism. Ethanol impairs thiamin utilization, and isoniazid interferes with niacin and pyridoxine metabolism. Ethanol and oral contraceptives inhibit folate (folic acid).\\n\\n57\",\n",

Liver disorders impair storage of vitamins A and B12 and interfere with metabolism of protein and energy sources. Renal insufficiency predisposes to protein, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies. Anorexia causes some patients with cancer or depression and many with AIDS to consume inadequate amounts of food. Infections, trauma, hyperthyroidism, extensive burns, and prolonged fever increase metabolic demands. Any condition that increases cytokines may be accompanied by muscle loss, lipolysis, low albumin levels, and anorexia.\\n\\nVegetarian diets: Iron deficiency can occur in ovo-lacto vegetarians (although such a diet can be compatible with good health). Vegans may develop vitamin B12 deficiency unless they consume yeast extracts or Asian-style fermented foods. Their intake of Ca, iron, and zinc also tends to be low. A fruit-only diet is not recommended because it is deficient in protein, Na, and many micronutrients.\\n\\nFad diets: Some fad diets result in vitamin, mineral, and protein deficiencies; cardiac, renal, and metabolic disorders; and sometimes death. Very low calorie diets (&#x3C; 400 kcal/day) cannot sustain health for long.\\n\\nDrugs and nutritional supplements: Many drugs (eg, appetite suppressants, digoxin) decrease appetite; others impair nutrient absorption or metabolism. Some drugs (eg, stimulants) have catabolic effects. Certain drugs can impair absorption of many nutrients; eg, anticonvulsants can impair absorption of vitamins.\\n\\nAlcohol or drug dependency: Patients with alcohol or drug dependency may neglect their nutritional needs.

The\\nMini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) has been validated and is widely used, especially for elderly patients\\n(see Fig. 2-1). The Simplified Nutrition Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ), a simple, validated method of\\npredicting future weight loss, may be used (see\\nFig. 2-2).\\n\\nTesting: The extent of laboratory testing needed is unclear and may depend on the patient's\\ncircumstances.

Mental status should be assessed, because depression and cognitive impairment can lead to weight loss.\\n\\nThe widely used Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) uses information from the patient history (eg, weight loss, change in intake, GI symptoms), physical examination findings (eg, loss of muscle and subcutaneous fat, edema, ascites), and the clinician's judgment of the patient's nutritional status. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) has been validated and is widely used, especially for elderly patients (see Fig. 2-1). The Simplified Nutrition Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ), a simple, validated method of predicting future weight loss, may be used (see Fig. 2-2).\\n\\n# Testing\\n\\nThe extent of laboratory testing needed is unclear and may depend on the patient's circumstances. If the cause is obvious and correctable (eg, a wilderness survival situation), testing is probably of little benefit. Other patients may require more detailed evaluation.\\n\\nSerum albumin measurement is the laboratory test most often used. Decreases in albumin and other proteins (eg, prealbumin [transthyretin], transferrin, retinol-binding protein) may indicate protein deficiency or PEU. As undernutrition progresses, albumin decreases slowly; prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein decrease rapidly. Albumin measurement is inexpensive and predicts morbidity and\\n\\n\",\n",

However, other factors can affect response to skin antigens.\\n\\nMuscle strength indirectly reflects increases in lean body mass. It can be measured quantitatively, by hand-grip dynamometry, or electrophysiologically (typically by stimulating the ulnar nerve with an electrode).\\n\\nLevels of acute-phase reactant serum proteins (particularly short-lived proteins such as prealbumin [transthyretin], retinol-binding protein, and transferrin) sometimes correlate with improved nutritional status, but these levels correlate better with inflammatory conditions.\",\n",

These\\ncomplications can be caused or worsened by prolonged gallbladder stasis.

Treatment with metronidazole, ursodeoxycholic acid, phenobarbital, or\\ncholecystokinin helps some patients with cholestasis.\\n\\nNutritional Support for Dying or Severely Demented Patients\\n\\nAnorexia or loss of appetite is common among dying patients (see p. 3485). Behavioral measures (eg,\\nusing flexible feeding schedules, feeding slowly, giving small portions or favorite or strongly flavored\\nfoods) can often increase oral intake. A small amount of a favorite alcoholic drink, given 30 min before\\nmeals, may also help. Certain antidepressants, megestrol acetate, and dronabinol may stimulate appetite.\\nMetoclopramide enhances gastric emptying, but it may take 1 to 2 wk to reach peak effectiveness.\\n\\nAdvanced dementia eventually leads to inability to eat; sometimes affected patients are given tube\\nfeedings. However, there is no convincing evidence that tube feedings prolong life, provide comfort,\\nimprove function, or prevent complications (eg, aspiration, pressure ulcers).\\n\\nTube feedings and parenteral nutrition cause discomfort and are usually not indicated for patients who\\n\\n                                                                                                             74\",\n",

Behavioral measures (eg, using flexible feeding schedules, feeding slowly, giving small portions or favorite or strongly flavored foods) can often increase oral intake. A small amount of a favorite alcoholic drink, given 30 min before meals, may also help. Certain antidepressants, megestrol acetate, and dronabinol may stimulate appetite. Metoclopramide enhances gastric emptying, but it may take 1 to 2 wk to reach peak effectiveness.\\n\\nAdvanced dementia eventually leads to inability to eat; sometimes affected patients are given tube feedings.

Thiamin is essentially nontoxic.\\n\\n# Thiamin Deficiency\\n\\nThiamin deficiency (causing beriberi) is most common among people subsisting on white rice or highly refined carbohydrates in developing countries and among alcoholics. Symptoms include diffuse polyneuropathy, high-output heart failure, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Thiamin is given to help diagnose and treat the deficiency.\\n\\n# Etiology\\n\\nPrimary thiamin deficiency is caused by inadequate intake of thiamin. It is commonly due to a diet of highly refined carbohydrates (eg, polished rice, white flour, white sugar). It also develops when intake of other nutrients is inadequate; it often occurs with other B vitamin deficiencies.\\n\\n80\",\n",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\nSecondary vitamin A deficiency may be due to decreased bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids or to\\ninterference with absorption, storage, or transport of vitamin A.

Both\\ntypes usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes\\nnausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal\\nliver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Unless birth defects\\nare present, adjusting the dose almost always leads to complete recovery.\\n\\nAcute vitamin A toxicity in children may result from taking large doses (> 100,000 RAE [> 300,000 IU]),\\nusually accidentally. In adults, acute toxicity has occurred when arctic explorers ingested polar bear or\\nseal livers, which contain several million units of vitamin A.\\n\\nChronic toxicity in older children and adults usually develops after doses of > 30,000 RAE (> 100,000\\nIU)/day have been taken for months. Megavitamin therapy is a possible cause, as are massive daily\\ndoses (50,000 to 120,000 RAE [150,000 to 350,000 IU]) of vitamin A or its metabolites, which are\\nsometimes given for nodular acne or other skin disorders. Adults who consume > 1500 RAE (> 4500\\nIU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000\\nRAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks. Birth\\ndefects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment\\nduring pregnancy.\\n\\nAlthough carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes\\ncarotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia,\\nin which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \\u03b2-carotene has been associated with\\nincreased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and\\nvegetables.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nAlthough symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute\\ntoxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and\\nvomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\\n\\nEarly symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry,\\nrough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized\\nweakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children.\\nFractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly. In children, toxicity can cause pruritus, anorexia, and\\nfailure to thrive.

Usually, pyridoxine 50 to 100 mg po once/day corrects the deficiency in adults. Most\\npeople taking isoniazid should also be given pyridoxine 30 to 50 mg/day. For deficiency due to increased\\nmetabolic demand, amounts larger than the daily recommended intake may be required.

Causes of Vitamin B12 Deficiency]\\n\\nliver stores (which are normally extensive) are limited and their rapid growth rate results in high demand.\\n\\nVitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption (see Table 4-5 and p. 153), which, in\\nthe elderly, most commonly results from decreased acid secretion. In such cases, crystalline vitamin B12\\n(such as that available in vitamin supplements) can be absorbed, but food-bound vitamin B12 is not\\nliberated and absorbed normally. Inadequate absorption may occur in blind loop syndrome (with\\novergrowth of bacteria) or fish tapeworm infestation; in these cases, bacteria or parasites use ingested\\nvitamin B12 so that less is available for absorption. Vitamin B12 absorption may be inadequate if ileal\\nabsorptive sites are destroyed by inflammatory bowel disease or are surgically removed. Less common\\ncauses of inadequate vitamin B12 absorption include chronic pancreatitis, gastric surgery, malabsorption\\nsyndromes, AIDS, use of certain drugs (eg, antacids, metformin), repeated exposure to nitrous oxide, and\\na genetic disorder causing malabsorption in the ileum (Imerslund-Graesbeck syndrome).\\n\\nPernicious anemia is often used synonymously with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, pernicious\\nanemia specifically refers to anemia resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency caused by an autoimmune\\nmetaplastic atrophic gastritis with loss of intrinsic factor (see p. 133). Patients with classic pernicious\\nanemia, most commonly younger adults, are at increased risk of stomach and other GI cancers.\\n\\nSubacute combined degeneration refers to degenerative changes in the nervous system due to\\nvitamin B12 deficiency; they affect mostly brain and spinal cord white matter. Demyelinating or axonal\\nperipheral neuropathies can occur.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nAnemia usually develops insidiously. It is often more severe than its symptoms indicate because its slow\\nevolution allows physiologic adaptation. Occasionally, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur. Various GI\\nsymptoms, including weight loss and poorly localized abdominal pain, may occur. Glossitis, usually\\ndescribed as burning of the tongue, is uncommon.\\n\\nNeurologic symptoms develop independently from and often without hematologic abnormalities. In early\\nstages, decreased position and vibratory sensation in the extremities is accompanied by mild to moderate\\nweakness and hyporeflexia. In later stages, spasticity, extensor plantar responses, greater loss of position\\nand vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, and ataxia emerge. These deficits may develop in a\\nstocking-glove distribution. Tactile, pain, and temperature sensations are usually spared but may be\\ndifficult to assess in the elderly.\\n\\nSome patients are also irritable and mildly depressed. Paranoia (megaloblastic madness), delirium,\\nconfusion, spastic ataxia, and, at times, postural hypotension may occur in advanced cases. The\\nconfusion may be difficult to differentiate from age-related dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n\\u2022 CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels\\n\\n\\u2022 Sometimes methylmalonic acid levels or Schilling test\\n\\n                                                                                                           87\",\n",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\nDiagnosis is based on CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels. It is important to remember that severe\\nneurologic disease may occur without anemia or macrocytosis.\\n\\nCBC detects megaloblastic anemia. Tissue deficiency and macrocytic indexes may precede the\\ndevelopment of anemia. A vitamin B12 level < 200 pg/mL (< 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\\nThe folate level is measured because vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency\\nas a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and may\\nalleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\\n\\nWhen clinical judgment suggests vitamin B12 deficiency but the vitamin B12 level is low-normal (200 to\\n350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring\\nserum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B12\\ndeficiency but may be due to renal failure. MMA levels can also be used to monitor the response to\\ntreatment. MMA levels remain normal in folate deficiency; homocysteine levels may be elevated with\\neither vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Less commonly, holotranscobalamin II (transcobalamin II-B12\\ncomplex) content is measured; when holotranscobalamin II is < 40 pg/mL (< 30 pmol/L), vitamin B12 is\\ndeficient.\\n\\nAfter deficiency is diagnosed, additional tests may be indicated for younger adults but usually not for the\\nelderly. Unless dietary vitamin B12 is obviously inadequate, measurement of serum gastrin levels or\\nautoantibodies to intrinsic factor may be done; sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be poor.\\n\\nSchilling test: The Schilling test is useful only if diagnosing intrinsic factor deficiency is important, as in\\nclassic pernicious anemia. This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test\\nmeasures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B12. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 is given orally, followed\\nin 1 to 6 h by 1000 \\u03bcg (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B12, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin\\nB12 by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B12 is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The\\namount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B12 is determined. If\\nabsorption is normal, \\u2265 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (< 5% if\\nkidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B12 absorption. Improved absorption with the\\nsubsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B12 confirms the diagnosis of pernicious\\nanemia. The test is often difficult to do or interpret because of incomplete urine collection or renal\\ninsufficiency. In addition, because the Schilling test does not measure absorption of protein-bound vitamin\\nB12, the test does not detect defective liberation of vitamin B12 from foods, which is common among the\\nelderly. The Schilling test repletes vitamin B12 and can mask deficiency, so it should be done only after all\\nother diagnostic tests and therapeutic trials.\\n\\nIf malabsorption is identified, the Schilling test can be repeated after a 2-wk trial of an oral antibiotic.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\n\\u2022 Usually, skin or gingival findings and risk factors\\n\\nDiagnosis is usually made clinically in a patient who has skin or gingival signs and is at risk of vitamin C\\ndeficiency. Laboratory confirmation may be available. Anemia is common. Bleeding, coagulation, and PT\\nare normal.\\n\\nSkeletal x-rays can help diagnose childhood (but not adult) scurvy. Changes are most evident at the ends\\nof long bones, particularly at the knee. Early changes resemble atrophy. Loss of trabeculae results in a\\nground-glass appearance. The cortex thins. A line of calcified, irregular cartilage (white line of Fraenkel)\\nmay be visible at the metaphysis. A zone of rarefaction or a linear fracture proximal and parallel to the\\nwhite line may be visible as only a triangular defect at the bone's lateral margin but is specific. The\\nepiphysis may be compressed. Healing subperiosteal hemorrhages may elevate and calcify the\\nperiosteum.\\n\\nLaboratory diagnosis, which requires measuring blood ascorbic acid, is sometimes done at academic\\ncenters. Levels of < 0.6 mg/dL (< 34 \\u03bcmol/L) are considered marginal; levels of < 0.2 mg/dL (< 11 \\u03bcmol/L)\\nindicate vitamin C deficiency. Measurement of ascorbic acid levels in the WBC-platelet layer of\\ncentrifuged blood is not widely available or standardized.\\n\\nIn adults, scurvy must be differentiated from arthritis, hemorrhagic disorders, gingivitis, and protein-energy\\nundernutrition.

Bleeding gums, conjunctival hemorrhages, most petechiae, and ecchymoses are\\nnonspecific.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\u2022 Nutritious diet with supplemental ascorbic acid\\n\\nFor scurvy in adults, ascorbic acid 100 to 500 mg po tid is given for 1 to 2 wk, until signs disappear, and\\nfollowed by a nutritious diet supplying 1 to 2 times the daily recommended intake. In scurvy, therapeutic\\ndoses of ascorbic acid restore the functions of vitamin C in a few days. The symptoms and signs usually\\ndisappear over 1 to 2 wk. Chronic gingivitis with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage persists longer.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nVitamin C 75 mg po once/day for women and 90 mg po once/day for men prevents deficiency. Smokers\\nshould consume an additional 35 mg/day. Five servings of most fruits and vegetables (recommended\\ndaily) provide > 200 mg of vitamin C.\\n\\nVitamin C Toxicity\\n\\nThe upper limit for vitamin C intake is 2000 mg/day. Up to 10 g/day of vitamin C are sometimes taken for\\nunproven health benefits, such as preventing or shortening the duration of viral infections or slowing or\\nreversing the progression of cancer or atherosclerosis. Such doses may acidify the urine, cause nausea\\nand diarrhea, interfere with the healthy antioxidant-prooxidant balance in the body, and, in patients with\\nthalassemia or hemochromatosis, promote iron overload. Intake below the upper limit does not have toxic\\neffects in healthy adults.\\n\\nVitamin D\\n\\nVitamin D has 2 main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol); the latter is the naturally\\noccurring form and the form used for low-dose supplementation. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in skin by\\nexposure to direct sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation) and obtained in the diet chiefly in fish liver oils and salt\\nwater fish. In some developed countries, milk and other foods are fortified with vitamin D. Human breast\\nmilk is low in vitamin D, containing an average of only 10% of the amount in fortified cow's milk.\\nRequirements for vitamin D increase with age because skin synthesis declines. Sunscreen use and dark\\nskin pigmentation also reduce skin synthesis of vitamin D.\\n                                                                                                            90\",\n",

Because abnormal lipid levels can affect vitamin E status, a low ratio of serum \\u03b1-tocopherol to lipids (&#x3C; 0.8 mg/g total lipid) is the most accurate indicator in adults with hyperlipidemia.\\n\\nIn children and adults with abetalipoproteinemia, serum \\u03b1-tocopherol levels are usually undetectable.\\n\\n95\",\n",

Rarely, these rings occur in other liver\\ndisorders (eg, biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis), but ceruloplasmin levels should be unaffected.\\n\\nCeruloplasmin: Serum ceruloplasmin (normally 20 to 35 mg/dL) is usually low in Wilson's disease but\\ncan be normal. It can also be low in heterozygous carriers and those with other liver disorders (eg, viral\\nhepatitis, drug- or alcohol-induced liver disease). A low ceruloplasmin level in a patient with a Kayser-\\nFleischer ring is diagnostic. Also, a level of < 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive regardless of clinical findings.\\n\\nSerum copper: Despite the copper accumulation in the body, serum copper levels are decreased\\nbecause of the decreased ceruloplasmin levels.\\n\\nUrinary copper excretion: In Wilson's disease, 24-h urinary copper excretion (normally, \\u2264 30 \\u03bcg/day) is\\nusually > 100 \\u03bcg/day. If serum ceruloplasmin is low and urinary copper excretion is high, diagnosis is\\nclear. If levels are equivocal, measuring urinary copper excretion after penicillamine is given\\n(penicillamine provocation test) may confirm the diagnosis; this test is not usually done in adults because\\ncutoff values are not well-established.\\n\\nLiver biopsy: In unclear cases (eg, elevated transaminases, no Kayser-Fleischer rings, indeterminate\\nvalues for ceruloplasmin and urinary copper), the diagnosis is made by doing a liver biopsy to measure\\nhepatic copper concentration. However, false-negative results may occur because of a sampling error\\n(due to large variations in copper concentrations in the liver) or fulminant hepatitis (causing necrosis that\\nreleases large amounts of copper).\\n\\nScreening: Because early treatment is most effective, screening is indicated for anyone who has a\\nsibling, cousin, or parent with Wilson's disease. Screening consists of a slit-lamp examination and\\nmeasurement of transaminase levels, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine copper excretion.\\nIf any results are abnormal, liver biopsy is done to measure hepatic copper concentration.

Mineral Deficiency & Toxicity\\nIodine Deficiency\\n\\nDeficiency is rare in areas where iodized salt is used but common worldwide. Iodine deficiency develops\\nwhen iodide intake is < 20 \\u03bcg/day. In mild or moderate deficiency, the thyroid gland, influenced by thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone (TSH), hypertrophies to concentrate iodide in itself, resulting in colloid goiter.\\nUsually, patients remain euthyroid; however, severe iodine deficiency in adults may cause hypothyroidism\\n(endemic myxedema). It can decrease fertility and increase risk of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and\\nprenatal and infant mortality. Severe maternal iodine deficiency retards fetal growth and brain\\ndevelopment, sometimes resulting in birth defects, and, in infants, causes cretinism, which may include\\nintellectual disability, deaf-mutism, difficulty walking, short stature, and sometimes hypothyroidism.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n\\u2022 Assessment of thyroid structure and function\\n\\nDiagnosis in adults and children is usually based on thyroid function, examination for goiter, and imaging\\ntests identifying abnormalities in thyroid function and structure (see p.\\n776). All neonates should be screened by measuring the TSH level.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\u2022 Iodide with or without levothyroxine\\n\\nInfants with iodine deficiency are given L-thyroxine 3 \\u03bcg/kg po once/day for a week plus iodide 50 to 90\\n\\u03bcg po once/day for several weeks to quickly restore a euthyroid state. Children are treated with iodide 90\\nto 120 \\u03bcg once/day. Adults are given iodide 150 \\u03bcg once/day. Iodine deficiency can also be treated by\\ngiving levothyroxine. Serum TSH levels are monitored in all patients until the levels are normal (ie, < 5\\n\\u03bcIU/mL).\\n\\nIodine Toxicity\\n\\nChronic toxicity may develop when intake is > 1.1 mg/day. Most people who ingest excess amounts of\\niodine remain euthyroid. Some people who ingest excess amounts of iodine, particularly those who were\\npreviously deficient, develop hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Paradoxically, excess uptake\\nof iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine\\ntoxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide\\nmay cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions.\\nPatients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also\\nneed to have their thyroid function monitored.\\n\\nDiagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. 776), which are\\ncorrelated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment\\nconsists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\\n\\nIron\\n\\nIron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body.

Mineral Deficiency &#x26; Toxicity\\n\\n# Iodine Deficiency\\n\\nDeficiency is rare in areas where iodized salt is used but common worldwide. Iodine deficiency develops when iodide intake is &#x3C; 20 \\u03bcg/day. In mild or moderate deficiency, the thyroid gland, influenced by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), hypertrophies to concentrate iodide in itself, resulting in colloid goiter. Usually, patients remain euthyroid; however, severe iodine deficiency in adults may cause hypothyroidism (endemic myxedema). It can decrease fertility and increase risk of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and prenatal and infant mortality. Severe maternal iodine deficiency retards fetal growth and brain development, sometimes resulting in birth defects, and, in infants, causes cretinism, which may include intellectual disability, deaf-mutism, difficulty walking, short stature, and sometimes hypothyroidism.\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\n\\n- Assessment of thyroid structure and function\\n\\nDiagnosis in adults and children is usually based on thyroid function, examination for goiter, and imaging tests identifying abnormalities in thyroid function and structure (see p. 776). All neonates should be screened by measuring the TSH level.\\n\\n# Treatment\\n\\n- Iodide with or without levothyroxine\\n\\nInfants with iodine deficiency are given L-thyroxine 3 \\u03bcg/kg po once/day for a week plus iodide 50 to 90 \\u03bcg po once/day for several weeks to quickly restore a euthyroid state. Children are treated with iodide 90 to 120 \\u03bcg once/day. Adults are given iodide 150 \\u03bcg once/day. Iodine deficiency can also be treated by giving levothyroxine. Serum TSH levels are monitored in all patients until the levels are normal (ie, &#x3C; 5 \\u03bcIU/mL).\\n\\n# Iodine Toxicity\\n\\nChronic toxicity may develop when intake is > 1.1 mg/day. Most people who ingest excess amounts of iodine remain euthyroid. Some people who ingest excess amounts of iodine, particularly those who were previously deficient, develop hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Paradoxically, excess uptake of iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine toxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide may cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions. Patients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also need to have their thyroid function monitored.\\n\\nDiagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. 776), which are correlated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment consists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\\n\\n# Iron\\n\\nIron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body. Heme iron, contained mainly in animal products, is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg, in plants and grains), which accounts for > 85% of iron in the average diet. However, absorption of nonheme iron is increased when it is consumed with animal protein and vitamin C.\\n\\n# Deficiency\\n\\nIron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies in the world.

We start by building an Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent Tool, which involves importing necessary libraries, defining the agent's state, expanding queries for better retrieval, and fetching relevant information from the vector store. We then generate responses based on the retrieved context and evaluate their groundedness and precision. If needed, we refine the responses and queries to ensure high-quality outputs. Additionally, we guardrail user input using Llama Guard to ensure safe interactions. Finally, we initialize and run the AI Nutrition Disorder Specialist agent, enabling it to answer nutrition disorder-related questions effectively and safely. This comprehensive setup equips the agent with advanced retrieval mechanisms and ensures safe and informative user interactions."

For dietary requirements, sources, functions, effects of deficiencies and toxicities,\\nblood levels, and usual therapeutic dosages for vitamins, see\\nTables 4-1\\n and\\n4-2\\n.', 'metadata': {'page': 23, 'source': '/content/Nutritional Medical Reference/Nutritional Disorders.pdf'}}, {'content': 'Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins (except vitamin B\\n12\\n) may develop after weeks to months of\\nundernutrition. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and of vitamin B\\n12\\n take > 1 yr to develop because the\\nbody stores them in relatively large amounts. Intake of vitamins sufficient to prevent classic vitamin\\ndeficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi) may not be adequate for optimum health. This area remains one of\\ncontroversy and active research. Vitamin dependency results from a genetic defect involving metabolism of a vitamin. In some cases,\\nvitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin\\ntoxicity (hypervitaminosis) usually results from taking megadoses of vitamin A, D, C, B\\n6\\n, or niacin. Because many people eat irregularly, foods alone may provide suboptimal amounts of some vitamins.', 'metadata': {'page': 23, 'source': '/content/Nutritional Medical Reference/Nutritional Disorders.pdf'}}, {'content': 'Treatment consists of giving oral vitamin\\nB\\n6\\n and, when possible, treating the cause.
